\section{Bacterial strain from ANTARES station}
Conjointly to the isolation of \textit{Photobacterium phosphoreum} ANT-2200, a second bacterial strain was isolated. It has been described as \textit{Acinetobacter lwoffii} (Kingdom:Bacteria, Phylum:Proteobacteria, Class: Gammaproteobacteria, Order:Pseudomonadales, Family:	Moraxellaceae). \\
In Chapter 4, describing the diversity in samples from March and October 2011, \textit{Acinetobacter} have been detected up to 1.9 and 2.3\% respectively. \\

\section{Oxygen time series}

Oxygen time series has been analyzed in a similar way as bioluminescence, temperature, salinity and current speed time series. However, due to a pronounced trend in the data with no clear explanation, as well as no pertinent results this variable has been taken off this study. Figure \ref{oxyIMF} represents the Hilbert-Huang decomposition filtered into 10 IMFs and Figure \ref{oxyHHG} is the spectrogram crossing both oxygen and bioluminescence Hilbert-Huang frequency decomposition.\\
